I use this blog to share an assortment of topics covering anything and everything. From Web Development to Poetry I cannot guarantee any consistency. I'll just post whatever suits me at the moment. 

### About me

I am currently based in Cape Town where I work as web developer at [Limabean](http://limabean.agency). Most of my work is in PHP (LAMP), jQuery and HTML5 but I have a keen interest in broadening my skillset and as such have worked with Java and Python as well. Although I'm a fairly competent front end developer my interests are more focused on back end and server residing code.

In my free time I play around with Linux, read books and/or comics, and attempt to draw or paint some halfway decent art. I also play PC games and regularly get frustrated in a game of DotA 2. When I can, I like to go hiking in the rugged and varied mountains of Cape Town. On occasion you may also find me at the beach trying my best to surf.
