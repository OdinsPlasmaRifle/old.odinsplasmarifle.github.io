A place for me to vent, share and learn. I'm interested in a huge range of topics. So, anything, from coding to poetry and art to games, may find a home here.

### About me

I am currently based in Cape Town where I work as web developer at [Limabean](http://limabean.agency). Most of my work is in PHP (LAMP), jQuery and HTML5 but I have a keen interest in broadening my skillset and as such have worked with Java and continue to make use of Python regularly. Although I'm a fairly competent front end developer my interests I'm more drawn to back-end systems and server residing code.

In my free time I mess around with Linux, read books and/or comics, and attempt to draw or paint some halfway decent art. I also entertain myself with PC games and often spend an evening grappling with team mates in DotA 2. When I can, I spend my weekends surfing in Muizenberg or hiking in the rugged and varied mountains of the Cape Town area.
