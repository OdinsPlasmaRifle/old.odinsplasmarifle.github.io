![About Banner](/public/images/theme/about_banner.jpg)

A place for me to vent, share and learn. I'm interested in a large range of topics. So, anything, from coding to poetry or art to games, may find find its way onto this blog.

### About me

I am currently based in Cape Town where I work as full stack developer for [Rehive](https://rehive.com/), a startup within the digital currency domain. I have experience in PHP, jQuery and HTML5 but I predominantly work with Python (Django) and Angular at the moment. When not working I dabble in Go, Java, and Erlang (or whatever new and shiny technologies are cropping up at the time).

In my free time I mess around with Linux, read books and/or comics, and attempt to draw or paint some halfway decent art. I also entertain myself with PC games and often spend an evening grappling with team mates in DotA 2. When I can, I spend my weekends surfing in Muizenberg or hiking in the rugged and varied mountains of the Cape Town area.
