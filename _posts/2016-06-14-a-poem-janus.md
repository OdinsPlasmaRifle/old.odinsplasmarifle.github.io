*A poem I wrote about a particularly memorable friday night.*

## Janus

Light and muffled sound,  
a roar of energy as I trip up the stairs.  
Darkness and light,  
A flash of pain, the sound flairs.  

Titillating, scintillating  
Energy pulsing in ribbons of sound.  
My teeth grind.  
Smoke swirling, noise roaring, my hands are bound.  

My heartbeat is a lie.  
Rhythms tripping, there is nothing sure.  
Only sound exists,  
Screeching and beating in divine allure.  

Eyes closed, mind open.  
A gasp of pleasure as the sound materializes.  
Hips swaying, head banging,  
Fists tightening, experience crystallizes.  

I breathe in,  
Hacking on the smoke, patterns warping in neon phases.  
Lasers tracing,  
Their focus sharp in the effervescence of the masses.  

I can't hear anyone  
They can't hear me, my voice is a useless mutation.  
Only music matters.  
Only the drive of another being's imagination.  

It ends, my ears empty,  
A roar of silence as I trip down the stairs.  
A heavy thrumming,  
The ringing escalates, the memory of the music blares  

Fresh air, windows down.  
The roads rush by amidst the muffled sound of traffic.  
The stench of smoke, heavy in my hair.  
Gripping to my clothes, experience embedded in both mind and fabric.
