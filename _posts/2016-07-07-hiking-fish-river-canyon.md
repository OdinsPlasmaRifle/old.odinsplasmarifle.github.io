## Fish River Canyon

I took a week of leave this June and hiked the Fish River Canyon with my girlfriend, Sam, and other friends and acquaintances. In total there were 12 of us in the hiking group. It was an extremely rewarding experience and I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind roughing it, is decently fit and wants a break from daily life that will feel much longer than the actual time spent hiking. There are no facilities, including no cellphone signal, so everything you need/want must be carried along with you: food, cooking gear, clothes, eating utensils, toilet paper etc.

Normally the canyon is done in 4 nights (around 5 days of hiking). My group decided to do it a bit differently and we descended into the canyon late in the afternoon. Instead of walking a several kilometers beyond the decent we stopped and set up camp on the river bank. This was a good idea as it allowed us to have some time to swim and spend a chilled evening together before a proper day of hiking. For our first night in the canyon, Sam and I both spoiled ourselves with pasta and bolognese sauce (mostly I just wanted to get rid of the extra weight).

Because of the great weather forecast, I didn't take a tent and slept in the open like almost everyone else opted to do. As a result the first night was a little rough. A strong wind picked up and started whipping sand all over our camp area. A little later the full moon rose and suddenly it was like sleeping under a spot light. I managed to make it through the night by tightening my sleeping bag cowl and pulling my beanie over my eyes. In the end I got some decent sleep, even with some wild horses meandering along the perimeter of our camp.

The next morning the group started the hike properly. The start of Fish River canyon in very slow and quite technical (especially with a heavy pack on your back). The terrain switches between loose and very fine river sands, rough rocky areas and large pebbled crossings. I very quickly began to abhor the sandy areas, but unfortunately the rocky portions were very exhausting and didn't provide much relief. Due to the nature of the upper canyon it can feel like you are making progress too slowly, but its generally OK to average between 8 and 10 kms on the first 2 days of hiking. This part of the canyon is very beautiful and stereo-typically "canyon-like" as it is very narrow with most of the hiking taking place right next to the river.

On our first day we made our final stop for the day after around 8km (rather than walking an additional 2 km to the next appropriate camping area). The second night was far better than the first, as Sam and I carved out a more elaborate beds in the soft sand beneath our sleeping mats. In addition, there was basically no wind. We still had to contend with the moon, but I was getting used to sleeping with a pulled down beanie so it wasn't too inconvenient (although for the duration if the hike I tended to wake up several times each night).

On Wednesday the hiking felt like an equal split between rough terrain and long sweeping gravel paths. At around mid day the canyon started to widen out and several nice cutoffs became available for walking. These areas allowed the group to walk on gravel while cutting off major curves in the river (rather than walking alongside the river). The gravel areas were amazing, and a huge relief after the days of clambering over rocks and slogging through sand. There was still a lot of sand and pebbles but our progress improved exponentially. The widening of the canyon altered the feel of the hike: much larger sweeping canyon walls were now visible and more greenery started to appear. Late in the morning, while walking across a sandy potion of the river bed, we encountered a group of 3 wild horses: The first significant piece of wildlife besides the barely visible horses that sneaked past us on the first night.

At about lunch time on Wednesday, we reached the Sulfur Springs. The Sulfur Springs are a natural hot water spring located shortly after the canyon's first major escape route. It is located in a pleasant place, with a couple palm trees and a fairly lush stretch of grass along the river bank. The only unpleasant aspect is the strong smell of sulfur. I was sincerely surprised by the heat, I reckon the water must be close to boiling at its exit point. It cools down as it flows to the pools on the edge of the river. I had my first full body wash since starting the hike at this point -- It felt good.

Wednesday night was spent at a pretty location alongside the river. The water was both still and murky but adding Aqua Salvia quickly sorted out any problems with bad water. It was a good night: we had smash, chakalaka and chorizo for dinner and then spent the evening chatting. The moon was starting to wane at this point and it was also rising much later than previously. So sleep came easier earlier on Wednesday night. Late in the night our camp was woken up by another group of hikers passing by in order to make some lost time... a bit of a moonlight promenade. We had encountered these hiking earlier in the day when they were debating whether they would complete the hike as one of their group was very sick. I believe they opted to send the sick member back up the escape route while the rest continued down the canyon (not exactly an option I would pick if I was in their shoes).

Thursday was the day our hiking pace shifted to a great degree, mostly due to much more friendly terrain. We made really good ground and there was a section where it felt like we were freight-training past all the sites in order to get to the 40km marker. We made camp along a very wide sandy river barnk. Parts of it were very damp so Sam and I camped in dryer sand quite far from the river. Shortly before preparing dinner a small herd of 5 or 6 Kudu galloped past the campsite along the rocky canyon side. It was fascinating to see them moving so fast on the treacherous rocks and loose gravel. The rest of the night was mostly uneventful although quite chilly.

On Friday, we started the last 2 days of hiking. The group split, due to some of us needing to get home earlier than others. 5 of us went ahead and had to increase our mileage considerably. We smashed out around 30km of river on Friday, and reached the 70km mark later in the evening. I really enjoyed the massive change of scenery we experienced over the duration of the day. The canyon became more like a river winding through hills and a bunch of extensive shortcuts became available. We passed several important landmarks and were fortunately walking primarily on gravel and hard sand. Several rocky areas had to be crossed but these sections were way shorter than any of the sections we dealt with previously. In the evening we passed the "causeway" and a random small building known as the "Pink Palace" (even though it was repainted white at some point). About 1-2 kms further we found a suitable point to camp. It was a very beautiful location..but there were a lot of bugs, spiders and weird whip tailed bugs (no, not scorpions) that we had to contend with (later in the evening it became a battle to just get water due to all the spiders swarming the muddy bug infested river banks).

We woke up about an hour earlier than normal on Saturday, our last day of hiking. I felt quite refreshed. We had a little under 20km to do before reaching Ai Ai's. This was the most "grindy" part of the hike, probably due to how tired I was. However, the canyon didn't get any less beautiful. Fortunately , the trail consisted of a lot of solid ground and there were very few rocky areas. My knees started to feel very weak at about lunch time. However we had made extremely good time and I realized we were approaching Ai Ai's when I started to see signs of civilization: a water pump building, a long supply pipe alongside the path and eventually a couple other hikers taking a stroll up the river from the nearby camp site. At around 13:30 it was a huge relief, after a long stretch of fine white river sand, to climb a short section of stairs and see the resort spread out before me.

After managing to make a last minute booking at Ai Ais, I ate a plate of chips and Russian sausages, had a gloriously long shower and then spent some time basking in the hot springs. Just to top the experience off I took another shower and headed off to supper to enjoy some eland steak. The next morning I drove 10 hours back to Cape Town, ate a stack of unhealthy snacks, and had a Gibson's burger and HÃ¤agen-Dazs for supper.

A pretty epic holiday overall.
